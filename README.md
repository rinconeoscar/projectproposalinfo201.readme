Project proposal 
VALORANT is the future of online gaming, an addictive and competitive game that has recently sprung in popularity since release in 2020. Some reasons why the game is upcoming range from its free-to-play access, consistent updates, developer reputation, and a mix of game genres appealing to both FPS (first person shooter) and MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) players. The agents players get to play are well-crafted along with consistent new releases of skins purchasable as a complement to the player experience. It’s unique gameplay experience has drawn in a vast player base in the millions, with people around the world vying for a chance to showcase their talent in the competitive scene. In the competitive scene, teams were created by orgs around the world to compete against each other in major events to earn titles and prize money. Results are never predictable, but most people question who is the “best” at Valorant, performance based from tournaments hosted by Riot Games. To answer this question we intend to visualize a function-based formula that is able to look at Valorant stats and data to objectively come to a conclusion of which region is the “best” at Valorant in all time. This function will be able to finally answer the question of which region is the best, which has been a major discussion ever since the beginning of FPS international LANs. Usually when discussing this topic, everybody has a bias that usually leans towards their home region, or if they support a team from that region. This project will reliably determine the “best Valorant players” and use just numbers to come to a conclusion on which region is currently the best based off of the last two international LAN tournaments (VCT Lock//In, VCT Masters Reykjavik). The two sources of data we will be using for this project were both found on Kaggle.com.

VCT LOCK//IN dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agarwalvishal00/esports-data-valorant-vct-lockin-player-stats

For the VCT LOCK//IN dataset, there are 21 columns recording different pieces of player data and 163 rows for corresponding players (data pulled from VLR.gg).
VALORANT Masters 2021 Reykjavik: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaykumar1607/valorant-masters-2021-player-map-data -For the VALORANT Masters 2021 Reykjavik dataset, 14 columns recording player data and 51 rows for corresponding players invited to this tournament.

Both datasets contain every statistical category of every single participating player and their corresponding region. The data itself comes from the game Valorant, and an outside source known as vlr.gg. Vlr.gg tracks players KDA (kills, deaths, assists), agents played, average combat score (points racked for aggression and dueling opponents), KAST % (kill-assist-survive-trade percentage), ADR (average damage dealt per round), kill differential, headshot percentage for each map played.

https://www.esports.net/news/best-valorant-players/ -The article discusses the best Valorant players in the world and their individual strengths and skills. The list includes players from various regions and teams, such as TenZ, ScreaM, Shaiiko, and Sinatraa. The article notes that these players are some of the most skilled in the game, with impressive stats, mechanical abilities, and game sense. The article also discusses the roles played by each player, such as entry fragger or support, and how their individual skills contribute to the success of their teams. Rather than basing the “best player” from each region through player statistics, it bases a player's success on overall team performance.

https://dotesports.com/valorant/news/best-valorant-players-in-the-world -The article, published by a renowned esports site, discusses the top Valorant players in the world, based on their individual performances and skill levels. The list includes players from various teams and regions, including North America, Europe, and South Korea. The top players on the list include TenZ, ScreaM, Sinatraa, Shaiiko, and Sacy, all noted for their skills. The article notes that these players are among the best in the world and have helped to elevate the level of play in the Valorant esports scene. More specifically, this article pulls from the same data source for our project, vlr.gg, like KAST percentage and KDA.

https://earlygame.com/valorant/best-teams-vct-2021 -The article discusses the best teams in the Valorant Champions Tour (VCT) 2021, which is a global tournament series featuring the best Valorant teams from around the world. The player pool was much smaller in 2021 compared to present Lans with over 150 players participating. The article highlights the top five teams based on their performance during the VCT 2021: Sentinels, Team Liquid, NUTURN Gaming, Version1, and Fnatic. Sentinels are noted as the most successful team, having won several tournaments and earned over $500,000 in prize money. To support their claims, the site pulls data of overall matches teams won to determine the top five teams. More importantly, the article also notes that the VCT 2021 was a significant milestone for Valorant esports, as it brought together some of the best players and teams from around the world and showcased the game's potential as a competitive esports title.

https://nerdstreet.com/news/2022/6/10-most-successful-teams-valorant-esports-first-two-years -The article discusses the top 10 most successful Valorant esports teams during the first two years of the game's existence. The list is based on the teams' overall performance in various tournaments and events, including prize money won and win-loss records since Valorant esports first became a thing. The top teams include Sentinels, G2 Esports, and Team Envy, with Sentinels being the most dominant team in Valorant esports history, having won several major tournaments and earned over $1 million in prize money. The article is very similar to our goal of our project, so we are curious to see if our results will compare similarly or differently with this article.

https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/top-20-highest-earning-valorant-pros-all-time-list-1408517/ -The article provides a list of the top 20 highest-earning Valorant professional players of all time, based on their total earnings from various tournaments and events. As the saying goes, the more earnings a player has, the better the player is. The list includes players from various regions, such as North America, Europe, and South Korea. The top three players on the list are TenZ, ShahZaM, and SicK, who have earned over $100,000 each in prize money. The prize money for Valorant tournaments has been steadily increasing, with the top players earning significant amounts of money for their skills and achievements. Again, with the article discussing the top 10 most successful Valorant teams, we would like to compare our results if the best region determined has the most earnings in the Valorant competitive scene.
